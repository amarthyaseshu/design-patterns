Practicing design patterns

Prototype design pattern:
The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows cloning of objects, even complex ones, without having to depend on their specific classes. It helps when object creation is costly (due to database operations, resource-heavy processes, etc.), and you want to avoid creating new instances from scratch.
